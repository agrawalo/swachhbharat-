Idea is to create a react native based mobile application:
----------------------------------------------------------
We know that litter is everywhere. Plastic bottles, plastic bags, cigarette butts, electronic waste ... each of these contributes to littering of the environment, chokes the wildlife, and threatens our planet. 

Swacchbharat is tackling this problem one piece of litter at a time.

Idea is to create a one click app that uses:

1. Geotags - to provide insight into problem areas, 
2. Keywords - to help identify  most commonly found brands and products that causes litter. 

This data will be used to work with companies and organizations to find out more sustainable solutions.
